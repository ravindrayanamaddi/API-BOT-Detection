🤖 API Bot Detection using Machine Learning

This project detects automated bots hitting your APIs in real-time using Machine Learning. The API predicts whether a request is from a bot or a human based on request patterns and metadata. The project is deployed using FastAPI and can be run locally or using Docker.

📌 Problem Statement

APIs are often targeted by bots that generate spam, overload servers, or attempt brute-force attacks. This project aims to identify bot traffic automatically to improve security and server efficiency.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Collection – API logs and request data

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Engineering – Create numerical & categorical features

Model Building – Supervised ML classifier

Model Evaluation – Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

API Deployment – FastAPI with Uvicorn / Docker

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.9

FastAPI

Uvicorn

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Joblib

Docker 

⚙️ How to Run the Project (Windows - Command Prompt)

1️⃣ Open Command Prompt
Press: Win + R → type cmd → Enter

2️⃣ Navigate to Project Folder
cd C:\Users\RAVI\Desktop\API-Bot-Detection

3️⃣ Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run FastAPI Application
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

5️⃣ Open in Browser
http://localhost:8000/docs
You will see the Swagger UI to test the API endpoints.

🐳 Docker Deployment

1️⃣ Build Docker image:
docker build -t bot-detection-api .

2️⃣ Run Docker container:
docker run -p 8000:8000 bot-detection-api

The API is now accessible at:
http://localhost:8000/docs

3️⃣ Stop container (if needed):
docker ps          # list running containers
docker stop <container_id>

4️⃣ Remove container (optional cleanup):
docker rm <container_id>
